# Current Progress

- Project bootstrapped with Python/PySide6 structure (`src/` split into core, ui, util).
- Document model, manager, macros, and keymap scaffolds implemented.
- Qt UI shell built: tabbed panes per split, file menu actions, two-pane toggle.
- Tooling in place: `requirements.txt`, `Makefile` with bootstrap/run/test targets, and Google Drive adapter stub ready for future work.
